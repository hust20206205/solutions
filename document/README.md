<!-- Hãy sử dụng Ngôn ngữ chung (Ubiquitous Language) trong domain driven design (DDD) với nội dung nghiệp vụ kinh doanh sau: -->

<!-- 1. **Khách hàng (Customer):** -->
   <!-- - **Mô tả:** Người sử dụng dịch vụ, có thể là cá nhân hoặc tổ chức. -->

<!-- 2. **Hóa đơn điện tử (Electronic Invoice):** -->
   <!-- - **Mô tả:** Hóa đơn được tạo và quản lý điện tử thay vì truyền thống trên giấy. -->

<!-- Bằng cách sử dụng ngôn ngữ chung như trên, chúng ta có thể tạo ra một mô hình DDD rõ ràng và dễ hiểu, giúp các đội phát triển, quản lý dự án và người dùng hiểu rõ về các yêu cầu và chức năng của hệ thống. -->
